## Overview

SyndiSync AI is the **AI-Native Operating System for Syndicated Lending** that automates and optimizes the entire deal lifecycle. Built for the LMA Edge Hackathon 2025.

The syndicated loan market moves **$7 trillion annually**, yet runs on infrastructure from 1995. SyndiSync eliminates the **$15 billion wasted every year** on manual processes, email chains, and fragmented negotiations.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Document Generation
Upload any term sheet—PDF or photographed image scan—and watch Gemini 2.0 Vision extract every detail. In **43 seconds**, generate a complete **LMA-compliant facility agreement**: 287 pages with perfect financial covenants, cross-referenced definitions, and execution schedules.

### 🎙️ Voice Commander
Natural language interface for complex financial workflows. Just say:
- *"What is the leverage covenant?"* → Instant AI answer with navigation
- *"Analyze ESG impact"* → Opens sustainability analysis
- *"Go to negotiations"* → Lightning-fast page navigation

### 🤝 Intelligent Negotiation Resolution
When banks disagree on covenants, SyndiSync's AI analyzes **147+ comparable transactions** and proposes market-driven compromises with **85% predicted acceptance rates**. Resolve conflicts in **48 hours**, not three weeks.

### 🌿 Greener Lending Intelligence
Every deal gets automatic **SLLP compliance**, real-time ESG scoring, carbon impact analysis, and green bond eligibility detection. Banks aren't just moving money—they're moving the needle on climate.
