## ðŸ—„ï¸ MOCK DATA STRATEGY

### Use Demo Data Files (Provided Separately)
- [ ] `demo-term-sheet.pdf` - Sample LBO term sheet
- [ ] `mock-parties.json` - 5 banks with realistic profiles
- [ ] `mock-negotiations.json` - 3 pre-scripted scenarios
- [ ] `covenant-benchmarks.json` - Industry data by sector
- [ ] `generated-document.docx` - Pre-generated facility agreement

### Data Loading Strategy
```javascript
// On page load, check if demo mode
const isDemoMode = window.location.search.includes('demo=true');

if (isDemoMode) {
  // Pre-populate everything
  store.setDeal(DEMO_DEAL);
  store.setDocument(DEMO_DOCUMENT);
  store.setNegotiations(DEMO_NEGOTIATIONS);
}
```

### Realistic Data Rules
- Use real company names: "Goldman Sachs", "JP Morgan"
- Actual loan amounts: $250M, $500M, $1.2B
- Real industries: Technology, Manufacturing, Healthcare
- Authentic legal terms: Don't make up covenant names

---

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL SHORTCUTS (Speed Over Perfection)

### Frontend
- [ ] Use Tailwind UI components (copy-paste, don't build from scratch)
- [ ] Use React Hook Form (faster than custom forms)
- [ ] Use Zustand for state (simpler than Redux)
- [ ] Use react-pdf for PDF preview
- [ ] Use Recharts for analytics (easier than D3)

### Backend (Minimal)
- [ ] Single Express server with 5 endpoints
- [ ] No database - store in memory/localStorage
- [ ] Claude API is your only external service
- [ ] CORS allowed for demo purposes
- [ ] No authentication (fake it with local storage token)

### Deployment
- [ ] Frontend: Vercel (one-click deploy)
- [ ] Backend: Railway or Render (free tier)
- [ ] Domain: Use free Vercel subdomain
- [ ] CDN: Let Vercel handle it

### Document Generation
```javascript
// Don't build complex pipeline - use template + Claude
import Docxtemplater from 'docxtemplater';

async function generateDocument(termSheet) {
  // Load template
  const template = await loadTemplate('facility-agreement-template.docx');
  
  // Get Claude to fill in smart parts
  const claudeOutput = await claudeAPI.generate({
    prompt: `Generate covenants for: ${JSON.stringify(termSheet)}`,
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514'
  });
  
  // Merge template with Claude output
  const doc = new Docxtemplater(template);
  doc.setData({
    borrower: termSheet.borrower,
    amount: termSheet.amount,
    covenants: claudeOutput.covenants,
    // ... other fields
  });
  
  return doc.generate();
}
```

## ðŸš¨ RISK MITIGATION

### What If Claude API Fails During Demo?
**Solution:** Pre-generate document, store locally, "generate" by loading file
```javascript
// Demo mode toggle
const DEMO_MODE = true;

if (DEMO_MODE) {
  return mockGenerateDocument(termSheet); // Instant
} else {
  return await claudeAPI.generate(termSheet); // Real
}
```

### What If Judges Try Edge Cases?
**Solution:** Disable features not ready, show "Coming Soon" badge

### What If Video Doesn't Upload?
**Solution:** Upload to YouTube as unlisted, embed link

### What If Someone Steals Your Idea?
**Solution:** Don't worry - execution matters more than idea

---

## ðŸ’¡ WINNING TIPS FROM YOUR SILENVIA EXPERIENCE

### What Went Wrong Before
âŒ Over-engineered (Tavus integration, Algorand minting)
âŒ Too many features (therapy + mood tracking + certificates)
âŒ Focused on tech complexity over demo clarity
âŒ Video didn't tell a clear story

### What You'll Do Different
âœ… One clear problem â†’ one clear solution
âœ… Business value front and center
âœ… Professional video production
âœ… Features judges can SEE working
âœ… Fake complexity, deliver simplicity

### The Bolt Hackathon Lesson
**Winner:** Simple AI video editor (barely worked but looked impressive)
**Your App:** Complex therapy platform (worked well but unclear value)

**Key Insight:** Judges see demos, not code. They vote on vision, not implementation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ DAILY STANDUP QUESTIONS

Every morning, ask yourself:
1. What am I building TODAY that judges will see in the video?
2. Does this feature make the demo more impressive?
3. Can I fake this instead of building it?
4. What's the riskiest thing that could fail? Mitigation plan?

## ðŸŽ¬ FINAL REALITY CHECK

### Questions to Ask Yourself Weekly

**Week 1:** Can a judge see my core feature working?
**Week 2:** Would a bank executive understand my value prop?
**Week 3:** Does my demo video make ME want to invest?
**Week 4:** Would I hire my team based on this submission?

### The Gut Check
If you had to demo THIS INSTANT to the CEO of JP Morgan, would you be proud or embarrassed?

Aim for proud. That's your bar.

**Remember:** You're not building a product. You're building a **compelling demonstration of a valuable idea.**

Good luck! ðŸš€
