## 💡 Tips for Selection
1.  **Consistency:** Try to pick footage with a similar color grade (e.g., cool blue tones for finance/tech) or apply a color filter during editing.
2.  **Pacing:** For the "Hook" (SF-01, SF-02), fast/chaotic cuts work best. For the "Close" (SF-11), slow/smooth motion is better.
